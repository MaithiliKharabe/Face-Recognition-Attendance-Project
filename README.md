# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project
Face recognition is a biometric method of identifying an individual by comparing live capture with the stored record for that person.
In this project, the OpenCV based face recognition approach has been proposed. 
This model integrates a camera that captures an input image, an algorithm for detecting face from an input image, encoding and identifying the face, marking the attendance in a spreadsheet.
